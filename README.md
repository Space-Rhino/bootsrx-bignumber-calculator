###  1. PROJECT SCOPE
###### JUSTIFICATION
> There is a growing need in scientific research and academia for calculation using very large or 
> very small numbers with significant precision. Status quo calculators are typically limited to a 
> maximum of 15-digit operands.

###### DESCRIPTION
> This project aims to construct a calculator that is capable of generating precise calculations 
> with very large and/or very small integral and floating-point operands (up to 100 digits).

### 2. DELIVERABLES
<pre>
12/04/2021 - Deliverable #1: The Project Plan
12/04/2021 - Deliverable #2: The Programmerâ€™s Manual
12/04/2021 - Deliverable #3: The User Documentation
12/04/2021 - Deliverable #4: The Final Product
</pre>

### 3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
> The software includes a graphical user interface that displays standard calculator buttons and a 
> text field that displays the current operand or result of the calculation as applicable. The user 
> can input operands and operators using GUI buttons or a keyboard. The result of basic 
> arithmetic calculations will be accurate using both integral and floating-point operands, 
> including very large or very small operands. Order of operations will be honored. 
> Some scientific functions will be implemented.

### 4. EXCLUSIONS
<pre>
The software will not provide the graphing capability.
The software will not provide the ability to input stored functions.
</pre>

### 5. CONSTRAINTS
<pre>
The software will target the Windows environment and will not be compatible with other operating systems. 
The software will be developed using the Java language.
</pre>

### 6. ASSUMPTIONS
<pre>
All team members are available for the duration of the project timeline. 
The project scope is approved by Dr. Roger West.
